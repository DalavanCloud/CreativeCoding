openFrameworks project that randomly generates and saves high resolution desktop wallpaper graphics created using Perlin noise.

You can view an example [here](example.png).

If you want to tweak some of the parameters and ranges look at the _initParameters()_ method.

Screenshots are saved in a folder called _screenshots_ on the same level as the project folder (you should change this in the _saveImageOfRender()_ method).
